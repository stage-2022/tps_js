        <p>Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Do a flip! Hey, whatcha watching? Okay, I like a challenge.</p>
        <p>Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. <strong> It's okay, Bender.</strong> <em> I like cooking too.</em> Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.</p>
        <h2>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</h2>
        <p>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Why would I want to know that? You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Negative, bossy meat creature! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Can we have Bender Burgers again?</li><li>Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head.</li><li>I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Moving alongâ€¦</h3>
        <p>Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! And then the battle's not so bad?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Say it in Russian!</li><li>Take me to your leader!</li><li>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</li>

        <p>Bender?! You stole the atom. I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew. Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?</p>
        <p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist!</p>
        <p>Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
        <p>Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. You are the last hope of the universe.</p>
        <p>OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!</p>
        <p>You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</p>
        <p>Guess again. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. No! The cat shelter's on to me.</p>
        <p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Tell her she looks thin. You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM! Who are those horrible orange men? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
        <p>Soothe us with sweet lies. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!</p>
        <p>Throw her in the brig. Tell her she looks thin. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</p>
        <p>You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.</p>
